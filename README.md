## 1000 days of Math
>Yesh, I'm going to learn maths for 1000 days
I don't whether I can finish this but I'll give my best, 
I can't able to focus fully on maths fir another
3 months or so (so i may get lil inconsistent).

- **I already know decent amount of Algebra, my end goal
is to master Precalculus and Calculus (includes 
PDE, DE etc).**
> I'll Post my progress in this rep.
